# DeputyChallenge

This is my (Orrie Shannon's) submission to the Deputy Coding Challenge.

Time Taken: ~4 hours  
This almost doubles the suggested time. This is because I chose to include several things that were not necessary to complete the challenge, but I think do a better job demonstrating my abilities to write scalable, maintainable code that is more likely to be found in production applications serving millions of users. 
  
Some examples of these extras are:  
-MVVM structure  
-Using a recylerview instead of simple listview, with custom views inside  
-Using Dagger for dependency injection
